		<h2>Favorite CMSC Subject so far and why</h2>
		<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far would be CMSC 22 since it was the first time I had to have a project related to programming. All the other activities were just small exercises but the project made it fun to work on to and made me enjoy programming a lot more.</p>

		<h2>Favorite GE so far and why</h2>
		<p>My favorite GE so far would be HIST 1. I always enjoyed learning about Philippine history or anything related to history to be exact. Despite the whole time it was discussed in Tagalog, which I am not very used to and struggles to understand words, I would still be able to learn a lot and strengthen my historical knowledge of our country.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Favorite programming language so far and why</h2>
		<p>My favorite programming language so far would be Java and its to be expected since my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22. There are very confusing aspects to it but I still find it way easier that the other programming languages taught to us like R and C. I was able to pick up on the topics somewhat faster unlike on the other languages (I still struggle on how pointers work on C).</p>

		<h2>Favorite food</h2>
